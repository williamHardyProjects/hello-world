Hi, I’m Will. I have a nose for translating problems into code and an interest in delivering products that give people good experiences. My experiences,  whether it's traveling abroad and figuring out how to order food, analyzing the mathematics of page ranking, or figuring out how daily processes can be made more efficient all speak to my enjoyment of solving problems, learning new things, and having novel experiences. I’m always excited about new technologies and new ways of doing things.I have taught myself the basics of web development before I made the decision to hone my skills in a coding bootcamp. I’m excited about the  prospect of becoming a full stack developer on an awesome team, making great products.
